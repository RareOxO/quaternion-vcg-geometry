"""Beat Segmentation for LVCG.

Pipeline Role: VCG [B, 3, T] + ECG [B, 12, T] -> V_beats [B, N, 3, P], RR [B, N], mask [B, N]

Reconstructed from paper Appendix A.4 and from how ``lvcg/models`` consumes the result.
The paper fixes the algorithm; the call sites fix three contract details that the
paper leaves implicit:

* Beats are R-to-R intervals, not windows centred on the peak. Index 0 is the partial
  interval [0, r_0) and index 1 the first complete beat, which is why the model takes
  ``states[:, 1]`` as its anchor and the TTT path strips ``[1:-1]``.
* ``BeatStitcher`` lays the valid beats end to end, each resampled back to its
  ``rr_intervals`` length, starting at sample 0. The valid intervals must therefore
  partition [0, T) in order, and ``rr_intervals`` must be each interval's own length
  in samples -- including the two partial boundary intervals.
* ``GlobalRREmbedding`` and ``masked_fill(~mask)`` need a boolean mask and float RRs.

Numerical choices the paper does not state, fixed here:

* R-peak search on the reference lead z-scored as in A.4 (mean removed, divided by the
  standard deviation when it exceeds 1e-6), with a height of 2.0 standard deviations and
  a minimum distance of ``min_rr_sec``. "Too few peaks" means fewer than three -- the
  minimum that yields the four intervals ``LVCG.forward_train`` asserts -- and triggers
  one retry at 1.0 standard deviation. The height was calibrated on 484 training-fold
  PTB-XL records against an independent detector on the 500 Hz VCG magnitude, never
  against labels: heights 0.5 / 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0 / 2.5 gave peak F1 80.7 / 84.7 / 86.7 /
  87.2 / 86.9 (precision 91.1%, recall 83.7% at 2.0). The remaining misses are what a
  single reference lead cannot see -- an inverted or low-amplitude QRS in lead II -- and
  belong to the paper's method, not to this threshold.
* Physiological R-R bounds 0.3-2.0 s. A peak closer than the lower bound to the
  previous kept peak is dropped, merging the two intervals. An interval longer than
  the upper bound is kept and stays valid: removing it would break the partition the
  stitcher depends on.
* More intervals than ``max_beats``: the first ``max_beats - 1`` are kept and the rest
  merge into one final interval ending at T, so coverage is preserved.
* Each interval [s, e) is resampled to P points at s + k (e - s - 1) / (P - 1), with
  linear interpolation, so the first and last samples of the interval are kept exactly.

Peak detection runs on the detached reference lead on the CPU, as the SciPy routine
requires. The resampling itself gathers from ``vcg`` on its own device, so gradients
flow back into the VCG -- which matters as soon as the ECG-to-VCG lift is learnable.

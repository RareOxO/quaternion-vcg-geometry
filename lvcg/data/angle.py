"""Lead direction vectors and reorder utilities for ECG multi-lead reconstruction.

Each lead is a linear view of the cardiac vector, e_l(t) = u_l^T v(t), and stacking the
twelve unit directions gives the lead direction matrix A in R^{12x3} (paper Eq. 2).

The vectors are the paper's Table 7, verbatim. Coordinates (Appendix A.3): x runs right
to left, y superior to inferior, z anterior to posterior. The limb leads lie in the
frontal plane at the Einthoven/hexaxial angles I 0, II 60, III 120, aVR -150, aVL -30,
aVF 90 degrees; the precordial leads sit on a transverse ring tilted 10 degrees inferior,
at 110, 70, 40, 10, -20, -50 degrees for V1-V6. Those angles reproduce every published
entry to five decimals, which the tests check.

Directions are stored by lead *name*, so any declared order is physically correct by
construction.

A note on the "mimic" order. The paper states it as (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1-V6),
the same as PTB-XL's native order, and that is what is used here. The release's probing
loader, however, swaps aVL and aVF on PTB-XL records "to match MIMIC", which implies the
opposite. The two cannot both describe the same constant, and the original file is not
available to settle it. It does not affect this project: the supervised PTB-XL pipeline
declares ``lead_order="ptbxl"`` and feeds PTB-XL's native order, which the paper's order
and Table 7 agree on.
